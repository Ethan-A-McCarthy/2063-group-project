## Introduction
NetPicks is an app to help you and your friends make decisions. Imagine you are at a friends place for a movie night and nobody is agreeing on one movie. With NetPicks you can solve this problem in a quick and fair way, everyone gets to vote for movies they would like to watch and then the movie with the highest votes will be shown and you now have the movie that the most people want to watch. Our app takes the current most popular movies so that it is up to date and is good for new releases.
